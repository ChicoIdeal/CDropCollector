# CDropCollector
WIP, not guaranteed to work for now.

# Contributing
To build and contribute this project, you will need to create a directory called "libs" and add some plugin jars into it.
- BentoBox
- FabledSkyblock
- UltimateClaims
- UltimateStacker
- zItemStacker

These plugins doesn't have a repo or their repo is broken at the moment I test.

You can delete the implementations but to your PR to be accepted please make sure it doesn't break the plugin.
