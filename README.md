# CDropCollector
WIP, not guaranteed to work for now.

# Contributing
To build and contribute this project, you will need to create a directory called "libs" and add some plugin jars into it.
- UltimateClaims
- zItemStacker
- PlotSquared Bukkit v3
- PlotSquared Bukkit v4

These plugins doesn't have a repo or the jar in the repo is outdated.

You can delete the implementations but to your PR to be accepted please make sure it doesn't break the plugin.
